### Nike Clone // React

#### {04/19/19} initial start  // {04/26/19} continuation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
https://www.nike.com/ clone using React
* npx create-react-app webpack creation
* https://www.styled-components.com/ used for styling

* Styled Components creates the largest separation of working environment between React and Angular.

* React .js files allows for all information (HTML / CSS / JS) to rest on a single file (unless global rules are created on a separate file and called in APP) opposed to Angular which has a similar separation of information, but to a more specific degree that can become cumbersome.

## Specs
* User will be able to manipulate the screen size and the information provided will render to that viewport accordingly
* User will be able to click on buttons in the top left of the Navbar to receive and extra bonus when shopping!
* User will be able to click on links in the navigation bar and be directed to the corresponding area on nike
